# ChatSage: A Weekend Experiment in AI-Assisted Development

## Project Overview
ChatSage was a weekend experiment to rebuild a Slack clone from scratch, focusing on robust documentation and test-driven development practices. This project emerged as a response to my previous experience building ChatGenius using Replit's AI agents, where the lack of upfront planning and testing made the codebase difficult to extend.

While I only had a weekend to work on ChatSage, I successfully implemented most of the backend infrastructure and began laying the groundwork for the frontend. Though development has ceased, the project served as a valuable learning experience in building scalable applications with AI assistance.

## Key Learnings

### Effective AI Agent Collaboration
The cornerstone of successful AI-assisted development is maintaining a continuous feedback loop:
- Regularly refine prompting strategies based on output quality
- Incorporate AI feedback into development plans
- Iterate on prompts to improve code generation accuracy

### Architecture and Planning
1. **Strong Foundations Matter**
   - Start with a solid data modelâ€”AI excels at generating comprehensive schemas
   - Use strict type definitions with centralized access
   - Adhere to established standards (e.g., OpenAPI) to leverage existing tooling and improve AI comprehension

2. **Consistency is Key**
   - Maintain uniform naming conventions across the entire stack
   - Document architectural decisions with clear reasoning
   - AI agents perform better with consistent patterns throughout the codebase

3. **Context Management**
   - Carefully manage context windows when working with AI
   - Break complex tasks into focused, manageable chunks
   - Provide minimal but sufficient context for each interaction

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Minimize manual code modifications to maintain AI-friendly patterns
   - Use clear version control practices with meaningful commit messages

## Conclusion
While ChatSage remains incomplete, it demonstrated the potential of combining rigorous software engineering practices with AI assistance. The lessons learned here continue to influence my approach to AI-assisted development.
